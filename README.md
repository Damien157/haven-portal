# 📜 HAVEN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

## 1. Entropy Generation
Every key in the Haven Vault is generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG), ensuring no two coordinates are identical within the 1-billion-node matrix.

## 2. Vault Security
Data is sharded into 1,000,000-node "Manifest Batches." Each batch is mirrored to the Backblaze B2 cloud infrastructure with a SHA-256 handshake.

## 3. The 137Hz Protocol
The system monitors "No-Waste" mathematical pulses to ensure the Master Node maintains a laminar flow during mass data injection.
